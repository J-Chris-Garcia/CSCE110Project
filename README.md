Project Option 2: The Netflix Movie Tracker
Description of the project: Python is a powerful tool to conduct analysis on large data sets and
visualize various attributes of those data sets. The objective of this project is to give you insight
into this aspect of programming using Python. You will write a program that reads a data set in
CSV format, analyzes the data set. Next, you will answer the questions provided in the following
section. You are allowed to use any libraries of your choice for this project.
Data set: The data set is a CSV file (2016_movie_data.csv) that contains several attributes of the
movies released in the year 2016. The data set is available here:

The data set has the following attributes:
● Movie name
● Release date
● Distributor
● Genre
● MPAA
● Tickets sold
You are required to answer the following question by writing a python program. Your program
should generate graphs. Your graphs should include the necessary label for the axes, the title of
plot and the legends.
1. Find out the details of the data set and print them. Details should include:
a. The total number of movies released
b. The number of different genres
c. The number of different MPAA ratings
d. The number of different distributors
e. The total number of tickets sold
2. Plot a bar chart of the number of movies released in different months. In which month was the
highest number of movies released?
3. Plot a line chart of the number of tickets sold in different months. In which months were the
highest number of tickets sold?
4. Calculate the percentage of tickets sold by each distributor. There are some distributors
whose percentage would be less than 1%. Group those under the ‘Others’ category. Print the
distributors in descending order of their percentage. Plot a pie chart to show their
percentage.
5. Plot a line chart that shows the number of movies from drama, horror, action and comedy
genres released in different months of 2016. You need to plot these in the same graph, with
proper legends.

Deliverables:
1. The code: Document your code properly. Every function must have a documentation string.
2. The project report: In your report, include the following.
There are 5 questions provided in the previous section (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Give a concise explanation
of your thought process to answer each of these questions. If the question asks for a
visualization, include the graph with its title in the appendix of your report.
Briefly describe the trend that you observe in each graph. Your graphs and explanation should
match the output of your submitted code.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Project Submission Guidelines:
Your team must pick one project from the two projects proposed.
The last day to submit your project is Wednesday, May 1st, 2019 at 11:59 PM CST.
You may resubmit your project as many times as you need until the due date. Only the most
recent submission is graded. Submit all your files on Gradescope.
No late submission will be accepted.
The project submission should include:
a. Your written project report in pdf
b. Your project file(s)
You are required to include the following lines in the header of all your code files:
File: filename.py
Author: Team members names
Date: 05/01/2019
E-mail: Team members emails
Description: Project option, name, and description
2. Group Work and Peer-review
This is a group project of 3 members per team. Every team member is required to participate.
You will be graded partially by your team members using a peer-review evaluation. If you need
additional help with your project, you should ask the TAs or the course instructor. The TAs are
available during regular lab time and office hours. You can also post general questions on Piazza.
3. Project report Guidelines:
The report should be typed. Neatness counts. We expect a coherent and professional looking
report that includes a table of content, a narrative, and a conclusion. For conciseness, your report
should not exceed 3 pages. The limit of 3 pages does not include the cover page, the table of
content page and the appendix.
Your report must include the following:
Introduction
Give an overview of the project.
Body
● Start with a narrative that describes the functionality of your program.
● Include all the answers to the project questions.
Conclusion
● What was your experience writing this program?
● Review and summarize your work including the challenges that you encountered and possible
improvements that could be added.
